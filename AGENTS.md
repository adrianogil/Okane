# Repo Guidelines

All source code is on src directory.

## Coding style
- Use 4 spaces for indentation in Python.
- Keep line length under 100 characters.
- Document new functions and classes with docstrings.

## Testing
- Run `pytest` from the src directory before each commit.

## Commit messages
- Use concise commit summaries under 72 characters.
- Mention the component or module being changed when possible.

## Pull Request messages
- Provide a short summary of changes.
- Include a testing section stating whether `pytest` succeeded.
